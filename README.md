# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

As an entry level data scientist at the new ride-sharing company, “PyBer”, we were tasked with an analysis of historical data collected by the company, in order to aid in informed business decisions made by the company’s CEO. Specifically we were tasked with separating the data by city type, in order identify discrepancies between the three categories- Urban, Suburban, and Rural.

During this module we utilized the following tools-

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

The results of the analysis are as follows.

## Results

From the compiled chart we can see that the rural areas have seen the fewest rides over the date range of our data set, with only 125 rides, compared with the urban area’s 1,625 rides.  The suburban area sits somewhere in the middle, with 625 rides, indicating that the majority of the rides take place in urban areas. This pattern continues with the number of drivers, as well well as the total amount of fares collected by city type. This is no surprise due to a higher concentration of the population in these areas

What is surprising about our analysis is that rural rides result in a higher average fare per ride, as well as a higher average fare per driver, indicating that rural riders are traveling further (if pricing is based on mileage), and the average driver is being paid more per rider picked up. This is great news for drivers, but may impact the number of riders in this area. 

## Recommendations

First I would recommend to the CEO that we increase our presence in rural communities Although a smaller percent of the overall population lives here, they have the highest fare per ride,signaling a higher profit. Many people associate ride sharing with larger urban centers, so a well executed ad campaign will increase brand awareness, and will expand ridership for PyBer in these areas. 

From our visualization we can see a gradual rise in the number of riders across the first few months of the year, peaking for both suburban and rural areas in the third week of February, followed by a sharp decline the following week. An additional promotion during this week, possibly a reduction in fares, could boster ridership during these declines, and may even help draw in new riders looking for the best deal.

Lastly I would draw in some additional information from the Pew Research Center, showing that a growing percentage of the population is moving to suburban counties. I would recommend trying to gain a larger market share in these areas as opposed to the urban counties, as these rides result in higher average fares, as well as a higher average fare per driver. Gaining an early foothold in these growing areas will help ensure continual growth in a competitive ridesharing environment.
